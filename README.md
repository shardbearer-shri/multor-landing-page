## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- FormSubmit
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt how to integrate a third party service to handle form based user interaction without a backend integration for less intensive jobs.

### Continued development
- A better hero section design and a restructring of some of the testimonials will be happening in the future.

### Useful resources

- Third party [service](https://formsubmit.co/) for sending form queries
- Side scrolling [API](https://swiperjs.com/)
